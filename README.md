## Blind Auction
**Description:**The aim of a blind auction project in Python is to create a program that simulates a bidding process where participants submit their bids without knowing the bids of others. In a blind auction, each bidder privately submits their bid without any knowledge of what other participants have bid. At the end of the auction, the highest bidder wins the item being auctioned, and all bids remain confidential
